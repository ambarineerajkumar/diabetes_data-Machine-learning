File: diabetes_data.xlsx
#  Summary:
The Excel file contains a dataset commonly used for diabetes prediction. It includes several medical and physiological features such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

There are 768 rows (patients) and 9 columns (features + label).

# Keywords:
Diabetes, Glucose, BMI, Insulin, Age, Prediction, Medical, Health, Classification, Outcome


This dataset is well-suited for training classification models to predict whether a patient has diabetes. It is clean and contains numeric data, making it ideal for logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, or neural networks.

Report (Summary Table):
Feature	Description
Pregnancies	Number of times pregnant
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness	Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin	2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body Mass Index (weight in kg / height²)
Diabetes Pedigree Func	Likelihood of diabetes based on family
Age	Age in years
Outcome	Diabetes diagnosis result (0 or 1)
